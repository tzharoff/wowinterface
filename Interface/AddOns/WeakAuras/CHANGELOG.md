# [5.19.1](https://github.com/WeakAuras/WeakAuras2/tree/5.19.1) (2025-01-30)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/WeakAuras/WeakAuras2/compare/5.19.0...5.19.1)

## Highlights

This is mainly a release to bump the TOC version for classic.

Some minor features:

- Empty region learned how to take an icon to display in the left side options pane (no more transparent squares!)
- Circular & Linear Progress Texture subregions learned the inverse option
- Unit Characteristics Trigger now allows "Assigned Role" for non-group units
- In game changelog (hi again!) is less prone to producing text boxes that tower over the edge of your screen

And some bug fiixes:

- Expanding the options for Glow/Border subregions should no longer produce errors
- Classic: "Clipped Progress" option for model subregions should function identically to retail now
- WeakAuras.ScanEvents is less prone to vomiting if called with garbage data
- Designing a TSU trigger to populate state with garbage timed progress data should no longer brick Options
